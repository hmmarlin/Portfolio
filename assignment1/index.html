						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<img src="assets/images/hannah-marlin-thumb.jpg" alt="Hannah Marlin thumbnail">
						<p>Hi there! I'm Hannah! I was born in upstate New York, but moved to Los Angeles when  I was a little baby. I did my undergrad at UCLA and graduated with an English degree. Not surprisingly, I had zero job prospects after college, and a longing to call a different city home. I moved to Chicago and survived two frigid winters before chickening out and moving back to LA. </p>
						<p>I currently work for an e-commerce jewelry company in downtown Los Angeles. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, camping and a number of leisure activities fit for any grandmother, including (but not limited to): needlepoint, knitting and macrame.   </p>
